# Twilio + WebRTC + Web Audio API = Awesome

## Setup

`git clone <this repo>`

`gem install sinatra`

`gem install twilio`

```
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

## Get the app on the public Internet

###Option #1

Deploy to the hosting provider or PaaS of choice. Remember to replicate the environment variables to your production environment.

###Option #2

Use a tool like [Ngrok](http://ngrok.com) to tunnel localhost.

## View the Presentation

Go to http://yourdomain/index.html in your browser.

## Connect it to Twilio

1. Sign-up for a [free Twilio account](http://twilio.com/try-twilio)
2. Purchase a new Twilio number or use the one you are given
3. Set your `Messaging Request URL` to `http://yourdomain/sms` and `HTTP GET`.

## Send and Receive SMS

Send a text message to your new Twilio number. You should get a canned response. Have a few people send a text to that phone number as well.

## Voice

Create a new TwiML app. Give it a name and set the Voice Request URL to http://yourdomain/random. Save the TwiML app and copy the App SID.

Edit index.rb and paste the App SID into line 34. Save index.rb and restart Sinatra.

Go to slide 12 and open up the JavaScript console. Enter the following commands:

$.ajax('/token').done(function(data) { Twilio.Device.setup(data); });
Twilio.Device.connect(function(conn) { console.log(conn); window.stream = conn.mediaStream.stream; });
Twilio.Device.connect();
When the browser asks for permission to access your microphone, say "Accept". Your browser will then dial a random person who sent you an SMS earlier and you'll be connected. Say "hi" to your friend.

Visualize the call!

Ok, don't hang up! Now it's time to visualize the call. Go to slide 13. In the JS console:

visualizeMediaStream(window.stream);

You should see a lovely visualization of the audio in your microph
